# AdmixTools-For-Everyone
This project intends to bring AdmixTools to every computer and hence breaking some of the esotericity. 

Here are the steps you should follow:
1. Get your copy of Arch Linux or any of it's distributions. EndeavourOS is highly recomended. For the record, I'm writing it on Arch Linux and testing it on EndeavourOS.
2. Clone this repo in your home directory and cd into it.
3. Just run the Downloader.sh script. Once you finish doing that - you're PC has qpAdm capabilities.
4. That's it for now. More to come:)
